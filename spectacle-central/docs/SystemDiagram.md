# System Diagram

Visualize all the interactions registered in the specs.

`Spectacle DSL` allows to register the interactions that happen while testing the spec,
then `Central` can use that data to generate a system diagram that shows the interactions between
all the components.

The full system diagram tends to be big, so you can filter the interactions in the system to view
only a subset of it, it is very useful to visualize more concrete data like all the dependencies for
a team or a service.
