# Central Wiki

It is a central repository for wiki pages written in git repositories, documentation closer to the
code tends to be updated more frequently but usually at the expense of the discoverability of such
documentation for other teams or non-technical team members.

The Central Wiki provide a middle ground that allow developers to write tech docs in a convenient
and lightweight format while still provide a better experience for reading and referencing it.
